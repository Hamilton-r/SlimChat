In order to use this code you will need a python version 3.7, you may have to download some dependancies etc
If I can figure it out so can you

1. follow this tutorial to grab some kyrics https://towardsdatascience.com/song-lyrics-genius-api-dcc2819c29
2. follow this tutorial to install, import and train a chatbot https://blog.hubspot.com/website/python-ai-chat-bot
3. add some custom code to enhace training with your lyrics file
4. run 'getLyrics.py', 'train.py', 'chat.py'... in that order
